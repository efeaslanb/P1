# P1 â€“ Distance-Based Auto Fan

This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure how close something is.  
The distance is shown on an LCD in both cm and inches, and the screen's brightness can be adjusted with a potentiometer.  
If something gets within 15 cm, a small fan turns on automatically using a 3V DC motor.

Built to combine multiple components into one setup and explore how sensors, displays, and motors work together.  
Had some wiring issues along the way but learned a lot.

The overall goal was to build a small fan I could actually use since it's been super hot this summer.
